Data for 2 tracking tasks is available:
1) discrete_pr.mat
2) standard_sos.mat

Each files contains:
pitch_data = 2 column matrix with [Time, pitch input]
roll_data = 2 column matrix with [Time, roll input]
taskname = character array with task name

Notes:
*Regard the amplitudes of the data as arbitrary. The signal commanded can be scaled by a gain 
to achieve the desired maximum amplitude.
